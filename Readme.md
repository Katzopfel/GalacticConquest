# Galactic Conquest


This is my project for the NASA Space Apps Challenge : Galactic Conquest.
Galactic Conquest is a 2D turn-based strategy game set in space where the player ship has to conquer more planets than the enemy.  
Players move their ships on a grid, with each type of ship having specific movement capabilities. Each turn the player has the possibility to move, upgrade their ship or conquer a planet if they happen to be next to one.


Victory Conditions: The game ends when one player eliminate the enemy ship or if the number of turn has reached 0.
